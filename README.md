**POC Recommender System with Surprise Library** </br>

Weâ€™re now going to use the Python library Surprise to build a basic recommender system. We will be using a classic dataset, the MovieLens Dataset, to build a recommender system that suggests movies to users based on the ratings they gave several movies. The MovieLens dataset is a set of 100,000 movie ratings for 9,000 movies provided by 600 users. The ratings come from the website movielens.org, a non-commercial site dedicated to giving users personalized movie recommendations. This data is very similar to the type of data you would find at large commercial streaming services.
